# Creative coding

## Description

This repository consists of visuals made in the Domestica course [Creative Coding: Making Visuals with JavaScript](https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/2729-creative-coding-making-visuals-with-javascript) using [canvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch/tree/master).

### Blobfish - Pixel manipulation

<img src="/visuals/blobfish.png" width=60%/>

This is one of the course exercises where pixel information is read from a picture and rendered as a new picture. Part of the values are randomly generated which means that refreshing the browser will render a different image each time. There is a Tweakpane visible in the browser where you can adjust some of the parameters used to render the picture.

### Turtle - Final project

My final project is an animation where the techniques learned in the course are applied. The wavy background is implemented with [Simplex Noise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simplex-noise).
